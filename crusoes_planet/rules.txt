If the Church has any spears then one is given to each player entering the Sandcrab path (as he enters), if he does not already have more than one. If the Church holds any diamonds they remain out of play permanently.

At the beginning of the game the Church is classified as either More Devout or Less Devout. The more Devout Church forbids violence, and so the government phase is skipped.

The less Devout Church does not ban violence entirely. Instead anyone who initiates violence or who joins in with an initiator is banned from the charity of the church until he makes penance by donating 20% of his goods and markers at the beginning of a trade phase.
