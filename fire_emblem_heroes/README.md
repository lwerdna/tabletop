This is an attempt to recreate the lost files of MingYang Lu's DIY PnP Fire Emblem Heroes game
before it got legal-bullied off the internet by Nintendo.

I'm in the US with access to only a US Letter printer, so that's what the script aims for. You can adjust it to whatever printer and paper you have.

The produced card sheets have the same ratio as 8.5 x 11 but are much larger. Your printer software will scale this down in an attempt to put it on a page, but if possible have it scale all the way past the bleed, not the trim, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleed_(printing).
