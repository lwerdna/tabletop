For example, here is a tiles sheet for 8.5x11 US letter paper for 3/4 inch tiles:

The images are generated by python which runs in the [drawbot](https://www.drawbot.com/) environment.

To generate this yourself, run tileSheet.py in DrawBot app. Then use imagemagick to set the DPI to 226 since the produced image is 2486x1920 and must map to 11x8.5: `convert -units PixelsPerInch tileSheet.png -density 226 tile_sheet_34in_usletter.png`. In your print settings dialog, choose 100% scale.
